## ü§ñ About
**EnduraBot** is a general purpose Discord bot I've written for the Endurance Coalition Discord server. It primarily exists as a fun technical project to sink my teeth into. The hope is that the bot's functionality helps solve problems and facilitate funny moments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
This bot is not necessarily intended to be a public facing "host-it-yourself" bot, though the code available should be sufficient to do so if you have the know how. 

I am not making myself available to support such endeavors.

The following [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) are assumed to exist:
- `version`
- `guild`
- `bot_token`
