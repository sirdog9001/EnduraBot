## ü§ñ About
**EnduraBot** is a general purpose Discord bot I've written for the Endurance Coalition Discord server. It primarily exists as a fun technical project to sink my teeth into. The hope is that the bot's functionality helps solve problems and facilitates funny moments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
This bot is not necessarily intended to be a public facing "host-it-yourself" bot, though the code available is sufficient to do so.

I am not making myself available to support such endeavors.
