## ü™ñ About
**EnduraBot** is a general purpose Discord bot I've written for the Endurance Coalition Discord server. It primarily exists as a fun technical project to sink my teeth into. The hope is that the bot's functionality helps solve problems and facilitates funny moments.

##  ü§ù Contributing

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
This bot is provided with an MIT license in the spirit of making non-critical software free and open source. 

While I am not against people reaching out, I make no gaurantee of a reply, nor do I gaurantee support with attempts to run EnduraBot elsewhere.


## ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence assists in the development of EnduraBot. 

**Code provided by a large language model is not inserted without modification and understanding**. 

A typical workflow is, after online research, reading of appropriate documentation, and existing skills do not permit me to solve a problem, a large language model will be given the problem I am facing in natural language. I will sometimes provide snippets of EnduraBot's code to assist in the model's understanding of my issue.

The model will then provide an answer and give back pseudo-code whilst explaining it's purpose. More often than not this code is not functional, either due to my lack of knowledge to implement it or due to an error with said code. I use existing skills to make said code functional. 

As I discover that a model's solution to a problem is inefficient or undesirable I do my best to improve it.
