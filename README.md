## About
**EnduraBot** is a Discord bot written for the Endurance Coalition Discord server. It's aim is two-fold. Firstly, to provide solutions to tedious activites that would benefit from automation. Secondly, to provide entertainment and funny moments to the community.

The bot's documentation goes over how to run the bot locally, how the bot was constructed and designed, and how to contribute.

Artificial intelligence assisted in the development of EnduraBot from commits [`010cf5`](https://github.com/sirdog9001/EnduraBot/commit/0150cf5959fe3553b92163eb7e60a10e7c1061fc) to [`a4a8b40`](https://github.com/sirdog9001/EnduraBot/commit/a4a8b4077d0c6f919a2f1180c500669a582eca66). 

From commit `a4a8b40` and onward all development is done without AI use of any form.

AI generated code may still exist in the codebase, though as to where and to what extent isn't knowable.
