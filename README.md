Artificial intelligence assisted in the development of EnduraBot from commits [`010cf5`](https://github.com/sirdog9001/EnduraBot/commit/0150cf5959fe3553b92163eb7e60a10e7c1061fc) to [`a4a8b40`](https://github.com/sirdog9001/EnduraBot/commit/a4a8b4077d0c6f919a2f1180c500669a582eca66). 

From commit `a4a8b40` and onward all development is done without AI use of any form.

AI generated code may still exist in the codebase, though as to where and to what extent isn't knowable.
