EnduraBot is a general purpose Discord bot written by Sirdog for the Endurance Coalition Discord server. It primarily exists as a fun development project with the aim of creating entertaining moments and solving problems which may benefit from automation.

## Features
- 15 custom made [commands](commands.md), ranging from providing comedic value to genuine community utility.
- Message listening detection to compel members to use `/alert` rather then just raw-pinging technical staff of the community.
- Message listening detection to have a percentage chance to insult members who ping the bot.
- Invite creation and usage logging.
- Sends quotes sourced from a configurable channel to another configurable channel with the presentation of a preacher quoting Christian bible gospel.
