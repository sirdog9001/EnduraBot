EnduraBot is a general purpose Discord bot written for the Endurance Coalition Discord server. It primarily exists as a fun development project with the aim of creating entertaining moments and solving problems which may benefit from automation.

## Features
- 15 custom made [commands](commands.md), ranging from providing comedic value to genuine community utility.
- Masochistic? Ping the bot and have a percentage chance to be roasted!
- Message listening detection to remind members to use `/alert` rather then just raw-pinging technical staff.
- Invite creation and usage logging.
- Get a quote out of context every day sent to a configurable channel presented as if it were a gospel being read by a Christian bible preacher.
